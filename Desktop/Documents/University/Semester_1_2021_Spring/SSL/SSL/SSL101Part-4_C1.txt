Original

“But despite the deeper level of knowledge that our computers will soon acquire, losing our jobs to machines doesn’t have to be a bad thing. 
Letting machines do the bulk of the work means that humans will be freed from routine tasks that computers are better at performing with higher accuracy rates, such as driving cars.” Bollegala, D. (2016, May 5).

Student

While there are a number of disadvantages to AI performing formerly human jobs, there are also advantages, such as the handover of routine tasks that are better performed by computers (Bollegala).

(Refer to 4.2, 4.3)

Check one option.

- It is an example of plagiarism because the student has not referenced the original information source correctly.

3.Question 3
Is this student’s writing an example of plagiarism?

Original

“But ethical issues arising from human and AI co-working environments is a real concern. It is one thing getting a face incorrectly recognised in an image uploaded to Facebook, but a totally different matter if cancer is misdiagnosed by an AI, which could very easily happen. After all, computers make mistakes, just as people do.” Bollegala, D. (2016, May 5). Robot revolution: rise of the intelligent automated workforce. theconversation.com. Retrieved from http://theconversation.com/robot-revolution-rise-of-the-intelligent-automated-workforce-58252

Student’s writing

Other possible implications of AI replacing humans in employment are the ethical concerns that might arise from interaction between the two. 
Bollegala (2016) points out that possible ethical implications might vary in importance however, with, for example, medical diagnoses outweighing other forms of ethical infractions.

(Refer to 4.1, 4.2, 4.3)

Check one option.

- It is not an example of plagiarism.

4.Question 4
Why is this student’s writing an example of plagiarism?

Original

“AI systems have already become far too complicated for the average person to understand, let alone repair, 
so there will be new roles created which will require people who can act as intermediaries between computers and humans.” 
Bollegala, D. (2016, May 5). Robot revolution: rise of the intelligent automated workforce. theconversation.com. 
Retrieved from http://theconversation.com/robot-revolution-rise-of-the-intelligent-automated-workforce-58252)

Student’s paraphrase

The growing use of AI in society does not preclude job growth. There are those that argue that, instead, the use of AI will lead to new forms of employment. 
For example, because machine learning systems have already become far too complicated for ordinary people to understand or fix, there will be new jobs that will emerge which will require people who can act as mediators between AI systems and humans (Bollegala, 2016).

7.Question 7
The following example of in-text and end-text writing is from a student using an endnote referencing system. The first and third references are to the Noda et al. 
(2013) article, and the second is from the Bollegala (2016) article. Has the student referenced correctly?

In-text

There are also potential benefits to the use of artificial intelligence in medical contexts. 
Researchers report that robotic surgery can be used to assist in areas such as eye surgery, which requires a high level of detailed work in a small area5. 
Despite the potential for issues with ethics becomes greater with these uses6, examples of robotic surgery such as these are commonly found in hospitals around the world5.

- The student has referenced correctly

8.Question 8
Below is an original quote from the Noda et al. article, and also the direct quote as used in a student’s essay.

Original quote

“Recently robot-assisted surgery has broadened its application and has been introduced into the surgical theaters worldwide.” (Noda et al., 2013, pg 1)

Student’s writing

Another important innovation has been the advent of robotic surgery, which Noda et al. (2013, pg 1) write “has been … introduced into surgical theaters worldwide”.

Has the student used the quote correctly or incorrectly? If it is incorrect, why is it correct?

(Refer to 4.3a)

Choose one option.

- The student’s use of the quote is incorrect because they shouldn’t have used ellipses.

9.Question 9
Below is an original quote from the Bollegala article, and also the direct quote as used in a student’s essay.

Original quote

“AI systems have already become far too complicated for the average person to understand, let alone repair, 
so there will be new roles created which will require people who can act as intermediaries between computers and humans” (Bollegala, 2013).

Student’s writing

Due to the high levels of complexity in AI systems, there will be increasing numbers of jobs in the future for “… Intermediaries between computers and humans” (Bollegala, 2013).

Has the student used the quote correctly or incorrectly? If it is incorrect, why?

(Refer to 4.3a)

Check one option.

- The student’s use of the quote is incorrect because they shouldn’t have capitalized the ‘i’ in “Intermediaries”.

10.Question 10
Is the following indirect quote from the Noda et al. article a good summary?

Original

“In conclusion, through the in-vitro evaluation of robot-assisted vitreoretinal surgical procedures compared to manual procedures, 
benefits of robotic assistance for the sophisticated vitreoretinal surgeries was confirmed” (Noda et al., 2013, p. 5).

Summary

According to Noda et al. (2013), research confirms the benefits of robotic intervention in in-vitro fertilization procedures.

(Refer to 4.3b)
